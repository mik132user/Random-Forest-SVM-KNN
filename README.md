# Heart Disease Classification Analysis

## Project Description
This project implements and compares three classification algorithms:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The data comes from the `heart.csv` dataset, which contains diagnostic information related to heart disease. The model classifies whether a patient has heart disease or not.

## Requirements
To run the code, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
