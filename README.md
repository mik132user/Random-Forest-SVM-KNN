# Heart Disease Classification Analysis

## Project Description
This project implements and compares three classification algorithms:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The data comes from the `heart.csv` dataset, which contains diagnostic information related to heart disease. The model classifies whether a patient has heart disease or not.

## Requirements
To run the code, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Results
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy scores. The results are as follows:

- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 98.54%
- **KNN Accuracy:** 73.17%
- **SVM Accuracy:** 80.49%

Random Forest performed the best among the three classifiers
